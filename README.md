Recently while messing with for loops and printing patterns into console, it struck me how I could practically make a program that prints out a mathematical function's graph.
In this repo I try to figure out how to further this.

> I have managed to make the simple for loop system to write out the graph. However, one problem I noticed was how I had to change the code for another function each time. What if I could just type it into the console, and it gave me the result? I asked this in a community related to C. What I learned is that what I'm talking about is not an easy thing to do, involving making my own LISP and "recursive descent parsing". I was provided with sources and now I'm tryina figure it all out. Mainly https://www.buildyourownlisp.com/contents
